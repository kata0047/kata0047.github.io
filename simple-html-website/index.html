        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>One of my favourite hobbies is exploring nature; I enjoy going on hikes, taking in the scenery, and welcoming new adventures into my life. I believe the adventures keep you going and make you want to explore more and more. I've gone on numerous treks in my life, not only to explore the beauty of nature, but also to explore myself.</li>
         <li>I also adore photographing the experiences with my phone or camera. Since I was a child, photography has been my favourite hobby. I enjoy photographing the natural world around me. Professional photography is something I'd like to learn because it will help me improve my skills and knowledge.</li>
