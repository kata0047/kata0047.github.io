        <h2>About me</h2>
        </header>
        <p> Hello, my name is Yashswin Kataria, and I'm a student in Algonquin College's Interactive Media Design department. I am a native of <em>Delhi</em>, India's capital state. I am now in my home country, but I hope to be in <em>Ottawa</em> before the end of the semester. My interest in design began when I was a teenager. After high school, I wanted to pursue a profession in design. In my own country, I completed a <em>one-year foundation diploma</em> in <strong>Art and Design</strong>. Here in Canada, I opted for Interactive media design as my specialization to learn about graphic design, web development, and photography. My short-term goal is to enhance my design capabilities and prepare myself to live as an international student. My long-term goal, on the other hand, is to pursue my dream of being a graphic designer and climbing the success ladder to become a successful entrepreneur by establishing my own design studio.</p>

        <p>In addition, my interests include trekking to new places, entertaining people, and cooking. I enjoy doing sports and going to the gym to stay in shape. During my school days, I ranked 2<sup>nd</sup> in an inter-school high jump tournament. In my spare time, I enjoy singing, watching videos of various performers, and watching football. I've always wanted to visit the <abbr title= "United States of America">USA</abbr> </abbr> since my favorite football team is the <em>New Orleans Saints</em>, which were founded in America. In particular, I'd like to visit <abbr title="New York City">NYC</abbr> and see Times Square. The state's aesthetic architecture is visually pleasing and appealing.</p>
